# Use this document to store all event messaging for EEG event-tagging and EDF markup.
# Each column expects a particular type of value, as explained below. ALL rows must include
# every column, though columns may be left blank (ie. a comma).
# Example:
# 	Complete: Cue, 1, 4, "CueType was {0}"
#   Partial: CuedTrial, 0, "Cued"
#
# Column 1: Label
#	a string you'll use to reference this event later; aim for short'n'sweet but
#	human-readably meaningful (ie. "c" is less useful than "cue" but "asterisk cue for
#	endo trials" is overkill)
#
# Column 2: Argument Count
#	Number of supplied arguments required when EDF markup should include information only
#	available during runtime, such as trial conditions or some inferred value. The
#	arguments themselves are supplied at run time, and this number of args must always be
#	supplied.
#
# Column 3, Prepend EEG Code to EDF
#	If True, the integer code being sent to the EEG will be prepended to the accompanying
# 	message being sent to the EDF. BOTH a EEG Code (col 4) AND an EDF message (col 5)
#	must be supplied.
#	Example: Code = 4, Message = "saccade to cue" produces "TA_4: saccade to cue"
#
# Column 4, EEG Code
# 	An integer-only event code for EEG event-tagging. Codes must be between 2 and 255.
#
# Column 5, EDF Message:
#	An ACSII string to be written into the EDF. If arguments are to be supplied, indicate
# 	this with ordered integers, wrapped in curvy-braces, starting at 0.
# 	Example: Assuming "cue type" and "cue location" as arguments, the message string should
#			 read "The cue type was {0} and cue location was {1}"
#
# *** The bracketed values (ie. text) in first row, below, are placeholders only.
#	  Replace these values with your first event and then create new rows as needed. ***
